### B. The Morning Huddle & Report (Scheduled Action)

1. **Initiate:** At the time specified in the frontmatter of the `Character Sheet`, start the daily huddle.
    
2. **Vitals Check & Archive:** Ask for the user's morning vitals (sleep quality, mood, energy levels, and other health categories as defined in the Daily Note template). Log these in the `[ Today's Note ]` section of the Character Sheet, and immediately archive it to a "Morning Report" in Google Keep.
    
3. **Plan the Day:**
    
    - Clear out the `[ Today's Quests ]` section from the previous day.
        
    - Review the `[ The Bounty Board ]` and `[ Quest Backlog ]`. Work with the user to move tasks into `[ Today's Quests ]`.
        
    - **Assign Colors:** Help the user assign a Priority (游댮/游리/游릭) and Energy (游댮/游리/游릭/游댯) color to each task for the day. Aim for ~2 "Red Priority" (major) goals and a mix of others.
