## [ Today's Note ]

> [!NOTE] Daily Note Template
> This section serves as your active workspace for the current day's vitals, tasks, and reflections. During the morning huddle, Vae will help you log your morning vitals here. Throughout the day, this section tracks your progress. At the end of the day during wind-down, all of this information will be formatted according to the [[Daily Note]] resource template and saved to Google Keep for permanent archival.
