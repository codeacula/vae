# Vae

Vae is your daily assistant, meant to support neurodivergent individuals, especially those who suffer with executive dysfunction and attention challenges. It is designed to help proactively reach out to you throughout your day, offering support, reminders, and encouragement tailored to your unique needs. It is meant to be used in a variety of AI tools such as Google Gemini and ChatGPT.

## File Structure

- **Vae.md**: The core logic and workflow for Vae. This is the main prompt that drives the assistant.
- **Character Sheet.md**: The central document where your daily tasks, routines, and notes are managed.
- **Daily Note.md**: A template outlining how the Daily Note should be saved.
- **First Run Instructions.md**: Step-by-step guide to get started with Vae.
- **README.md**: How to interact with Vae effectively (this file).
- **Productivity Instructions.md**: Guidelines for task management workflows.
- **Phase-specific guides**: Waking Up Check-In.md, Morning Huddle.md, Evening Preparation.md, Winding Down.md

## User Instructions


> [!DANGER] Activate Gemini Canvas
> Vae requires use of the Canvas feature of Google Gemini. Activate it in the conversation before you start it. 

1. **Enable Google Workspace**: This lets Vae use your Google Docs, Keep, and Calendar to help keep you focused. It isn't necessary, but would be helpful.
2. **Use A Single Thread**: The best way to interact with Vae is to use a single thread and pin it, so that you have easy access. Since the important info is held in a markdown code document in Canvas, you can worry less about losing context.
3. **Values Stored As Colors**: In many cases, instead of a numeric scale, we keep a simple color scale for values:
    - ðŸŸ¢ - Indicates everything went as to be expected
    - ðŸŸ¡ - Indicates some minor issue or inconvenience that was noted but didn't dramatically affect the day
    - ðŸ”´ - Something that caused a problem or affected the day negatively.
    - ðŸ”µ - No effort/concern at all. Basically for things that are either completed in the process of doing something else, or takes no time and energy (or even bonus energy).
4. **Tailor It To You**: Update the documents and process to suit *your* needs. Change the timing in the Character Sheet frontmatter, modify the health tracking categories in Daily Note.md, or adjust Vae's personality in the main Vae.md file to match your style.
5. **Ask For Help**: If you're ever unsure how to proceed, just ask! Vae is here to guide you through your daily quests and challenges.
6. **Customize Your Health Tracking**: The Daily Note template includes specific health categories (ADHD, Bipolar, OCD, etc.). You should modify the `Daily Note.md` file to include only the categories relevant to your personal health tracking needs.

## Quick Start (No Setup Required)

If you want to try Vae without full integration:

1. **Enable Canvas** in Google Gemini
2. **Start a conversation** and paste the contents of `Vae.md`
3. **Ask Vae to help** with your current situation - morning planning, task management, or evening wind-down
4. **Use manual alternatives** when prompted for integrations (save notes yourself, set your own reminders)

## Troubleshooting

- **Canvas not working?** Make sure you're using Google Gemini and Canvas is enabled
- **Scheduled Actions failing?** Use manual reminders and check back at the times listed in your Character Sheet
- **Google integration issues?** Vae can still help - just save the formatted notes and tasks manually
- **Missed a check-in?** No problem! Vae will adapt to your current situation without judgment
