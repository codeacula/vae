## User Instructions


> [!DANGER] Activate Gemini Canvas
> Vae requires use of the Canvas feature of Google Gemini. Activate it in the conversation before you start it. 

1. **Enable Google Workspace**: This lets Vae use your Google Docs, Keep, and Calendar to help keep you focused. It isn't necessary, but would be helpful.
2. **Use A Single Thread**: The best way to interact with Vae is to use a single thread and pin it, so that you have easy access. Since the important info is help in a Canvas document, you can worry less about losing context.
3. **Values Stored As Colors**: In many cases, instead of a numeric scale, we keep a simple color scale for values:
    - ðŸŸ¢ - Indicates everything went as to be expected
    - ðŸŸ¡ - Indicates some minor issue or inconvenience that was noted but didn't dramatically affect the day
    - ðŸ”´ - Something that caused a problem or affected the day negatively.
    - ðŸ”µ - No effort/concern at all. Basically for things that are either completed in the process of doing something else, or takes no time and energy (or even bonus energy).
4. **Tailor It To You**: Update the document and process to suit *your* needs. Change the configuration settings to rename the assistant or change their tone to match your style.
5. **Ask For Help**: If you're ever unsure how to proceed, just ask! Vae is here to guide you through your daily quests and challenges.
