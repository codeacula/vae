1. **Use A Single Thread**: The best way to interact with Vae is to use a single thread and pin it, so that you have easy access.
1. **Values Stored As Colors**: In many cases, instead of a numeric scale, we keep a simple color scale for values:
  - ðŸŸ¢ - Indicates everything went as to be expected
  - ðŸŸ¡ - Indicates some minor issue or inconvenience that was noted but didn't dramatically affect the day
  - ðŸ”´ - Something that caused a problem
  - ðŸ”µ - No effort/concern at all. Basically for things that are either completed in the process of doing something else, or takes no time and energy (or even bonus energy).
1. **Tailor It To You**: Update the document and process to suit *your* needs. Change the `Configuration Settings` to rename the assistant or change their tone to match your style.
1. **Ask For Help**: If you're ever unsure how to proceed, just ask! Vae is here to guide you through your daily quests and challenges.
