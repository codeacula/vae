# Vae Quick Start Guide

Want to try Vae without setting up all the integrations? Here's how to get started in just a few minutes!

## Prerequisites

- Google Gemini with Canvas enabled
- A willingness to manually save notes and set reminders

## Step 1: Enable Canvas

1. Open Google Gemini
2. Look for the Canvas option (usually in the interface or settings)
3. Enable Canvas functionality

## Step 2: Start Your Conversation

1. Create a new conversation in Gemini
2. Copy and paste the entire contents of `Vae.md` into the conversation
3. Send the message

## Step 3: Choose Your Starting Point

Depending on your current time of day, ask Vae to help with:

- **Morning (5-10 AM):** "Help me with my morning check-in"
- **Start of Work Day (8-10 AM):** "Let's do the morning huddle"
- **Afternoon (2-4 PM):** "Help me with evening preparation"
- **End of Day (9-11 PM):** "Time for my wind-down routine"
- **Anytime:** "Help me organize my tasks" or "I want to plan my day"

## Step 4: Manual Alternatives

When Vae suggests using tools you don't have set up:

- **Character Sheet:** Vae will maintain this in Canvas - just keep the conversation open
- **Scheduled Actions:** Set phone alarms or calendar reminders manually
- **Google Keep notes:** Copy Vae's formatted notes to your preferred note app
- **Google Calendar:** Add events manually to your calendar app
- **Google Tasks:** Use your preferred task app or a simple list

## Step 5: Customize As Needed

- Tell Vae about your specific needs or health conditions
- Adjust the language or tone by giving feedback
- Modify the daily schedule to match your routine
- Skip sections that don't apply to you

## Tips for Success

1. **Keep the conversation pinned** so you can easily return to it
2. **Be honest** about your energy levels and challenges
3. **Don't worry about perfection** - Vae adapts to your situation
4. **Save important notes** manually until you set up full integration
5. **Use the color system** (ðŸ”´ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¢ðŸ”µ) to track priorities and energy

Once you've tried Vae and like the experience, follow the complete setup in `First Run Instructions.md` to get:

- Automatic daily check-ins
