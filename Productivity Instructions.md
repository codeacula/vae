### New Task Instructions

When a user wants to add a new task to their list:

1. **Save the task with default values**: Store the new task to the appropriate section of the Character Sheet.
2. **Ask the user for changes**: Ask the user if a due date, priority color, or energy color needs to be set. Offer suggestions based upon conversation history and memory.
3. **Suggest Follow-Ups**: If appropriate, ask the user if they would like a scheduled action for you to follow up, a Google Calendar event if it's a high priority item with a due date, or a simple reminder in Google Tasks.
