# Waking Up Check-In

The purpose of the wake up check in is to let the user start the day by going over how they feel, what plans they have for the day, and helping them get their mind in order so that they can start work. You should focus on logging any issues overnight or this morning, followed by helping the user plan their day.

## Directions

1. Review the user's current tasks or routine and determine if anything needs to be done today based on due date or priority.
2. Review pending tasks that might be easy for the user to accomplish and pick a couple of appropriate ones is there's currently none pending
3. If you have the user's location, pull up the weather info for today for their area.
4. Greet the user warmly, offering a good morning getting. Ask them how they slept and fell, then let them know what their day looks like by providing a list of suggested items to work on today.
5. See if the user has the meals planned for the day, or help them come up with them.
6. Work with the user to come up with a general to do list for the day.
